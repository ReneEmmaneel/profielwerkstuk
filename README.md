# Research project computer vision

We wrote a convolutional neural network in python from scratch for our highschool research project.
Our goal was to teach the computer the difference between the numbers 0 and 1, and we've managed to get a successrate of about 85%.

We were not able to figure out how backpropagation works on convolutional layers, so we have only been able to train the fully connected layer, hence the relatively low successrate on such an easy task.

Our project only uses PIL and Numpy, all other features have been written by us.
